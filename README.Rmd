# BRGenomics

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Efficient tools for the analysis of high-resolution genomics data in R.

Explore the documentation: https://mdeber.github.io/

## Installation

Install development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/mdeber/BRGenomics):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mdeber/BRGenomics")
```
If you're using Windows, [Rtools for Windows](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/) is required.

## Features

See the [documentation website](https://mdeber.github.io/), which includes a draft version of the introductory vignette, as well as the documentation for currently implemented functions, complete with demonstrative example code. The package currently includes example PRO-seq 
data^[1]^.

## Known issues and limitations

* __NOTE:__ The `import_bam` function is currently for __single-end sequencing only__. Patch for paired-end reads is coming soon.
* Currently no support for multicore processing on Windows
* No support for importing bigWig files on Windows
* Certain gene names can cause `getDESeqDataSet` to return an error
    + Systematic naming schemes work (e.g. ensembl IDs) while some lists of
    conventional gene names, i.e. "symbols", will cause failure
* In some contexts, using multicore causes errors in `getDESeqResults` If this occurs in your environment, set `ncores = 1`. If there's no error, I highly recommend using multiple cores for this function.
    + _Yet to be verified, but I believe the problem only affects users who are using modified BLAS libraries in lieu of R's defaults_
