\title{Find sites with max signal in regions of interest}
\usage{
getMaxPositionsBySignal(
  regions.gr,
  dataset.gr,
  binsize = 1,
  field = "score",
  keep_score = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{regions.gr}{A GRanges object containing regions of interest.}

\item{dataset.gr}{A GRanges object in which signal is contained in metadata
(typically in the "score" field).}

\item{binsize}{The size of bin in which to calculate signal scores.}

\item{field}{The metadata field of \code{dataset.gr} to be counted.}

\item{keep_score}{Logical indicating if the signal value at the max site
should be reported. If set to \code{TRUE}, the values are kept as a new
metadata column in \code{regions.gr}.}
}
\value{
Output is a GRanges object with regions.gr metadata, but each range
  only contains the site within each \code{regions.gr} range that had the
  most signal. If \code{binsize != 1}, a single site is still returned, but
  its position is set to the center of the bin. If the binsize is even, the
  site is rounded to be closer to the beginning of the range. If
  \code{keep_score = TRUE}, then the output will also have metadata for score
  at the max site. The output is \emph{not} necessarily same length as
  \code{regions.gr}, as regions without signal are not returned. If \emph{no
  regions} have signal (e.g. as could happen if running this function on a
  single region), the function will return an empty GRanges object with
  intact metadata columns.
}
\description{
For each signal-containing region of interest, find the single site with the
most signal. Sites can be found at base-pair resolution, or defined for
larger bins.
