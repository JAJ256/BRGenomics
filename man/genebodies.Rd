\usage{
genebodies(

  fix.start = "start",
  fix.end = "end",
  min.window = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genelist}{A GRanges object containing genes of interest.}

\item{start}{Depending on \code{fix.start}, the distance from either the
strand-specific start or end site to begin the returned ranges. If
positive, the returned range will begin downstream of the reference
position; negative numbers are used to return sites upstream of the
reference. Set \code{start = 0} to return the reference position.}

\item{end}{Identical to the \code{start} argument, but defines the
strand-specific end position of returned ranges. \code{end} must be
downstream of \code{start}.}

\item{fix.start}{The reference point to use for defining the strand-specific
start positions of returned ranges, either \code{"start"} or \code{"end"}.}

\item{fix.end}{The reference point to use for defining the strand-specific
end positions of returned ranges, either \code{"start"} or \code{"end"}.
Cannot be set to \code{"start"} if \code{fix.start = "end"}.}

\item{min.window}{When \code{fix.start = "start"} and \code{fix.end = "end"},
\code{min.window} defines the minimum size (width) of a returned range.
However, when \code{fix.end = fix.start}, all returned ranges have the same
width, and \code{min.window} simply size-filters the input ranges.}
}
\value{
A GRanges object that may be shorter than \code{genelist} due to loss
  of short ranges.
}
\description{
This function returns ranges that are defined relative to the strand-specific
start and end sites of regions of interest (usually genes). Unlike
\code{\link[GenomicRanges:promoters]{GenomicRanges::promoters}}, distances
can be upstream or downstream based on the sign, and both the start and end
of the returned regions can be defined in terms of either the start of end
site of the input ranges. For example, \code{genebodies(txs, -50, 150,
fix.end = "start")} is equivalent to \code{promoters(txs, 50, 150)}. The
default arguments return ranges that begin 300 bases downstream of the
original start positions, and end 300 bases upstream of the original end
positions.
