#' PRO-seq was originally sequenced on a GAIIx by the authors. Reads were
#' trimmed using Cutadapt; re-aligned using bowtie2; Rsamtools and
#' GenomeAlignments were used to truncate alignments to only the 3' ends of the
#' nascent RNA; base-pair resolution coverage was calculated using IRanges;
#' bigWig files were exported using rtracklayer; and this package was used
#' to import the bigWigs and re-export bigWigs containing only signal for
#' chromosome 2L.
